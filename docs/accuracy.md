# Accuracy Benchmarks

In srt-slurm, users can run different accuracy benchmarks by setting the benchmark section in the config yaml file. Supported benchmarks include `mmlu`, `gpqa`, `longbenchv2`, `lm-eval`, and AIME (via the script under `configs/aime/`).

**Note**: The `context-length` argument in the config yaml needs to be larger than the `max_tokens` argument of accuracy benchmark.


## How Scoring Works

Accuracy benchmarks send a fixed dataset through the running OpenAI-compatible endpoint and compare each model
response against the benchmark's expected answer. For AIME, NeMo Skills prompts the model to put the final answer in
`\boxed{...}`, extracts that final boxed answer, and grades it with its math evaluator. There is no LLM judge in the
default AIME path; the score is computed from exact/symbolic correctness.

When `repeat` is greater than 1, the benchmark runs multiple sampled generations per problem. NeMo Skills summarizes
metrics across those generations, which is useful for comparing pass@1-style deterministic accuracy and sampled
accuracy on the same serving setup.


## AIME

AIME runs in the official **NeMo Skills container** (`nvcr.io/nvidia/eval-factory/nemo-skills:26.03`),
side-by-side with the model server. There is no first-class `type: aime` runner —
the eval logic lives in `configs/aime/run.sh` and recipes wire it up via
`type: custom`.

### Recipe shape

```yaml
benchmark:
  type: custom
  container_image: nemo-skills    # alias defined in srtslurm.yaml `containers:`
                                  # or the full nvcr.io URI for Pyxis auto-pull
  env:
    OPENAI_API_KEY: "EMPTY"       # ns/litellm requires it set; value is unused
    HF_TOKEN: "${HF_TOKEN}"       # for gated HF datasets via ns prepare_data
    # Optional knob overrides — defaults match the upstream reasoning-eval reference:
    # MODEL: "dspro"           # must match served-model-name from sglang_config
    # DATASET: "aime25"        # aime24 | aime25 | aime26
    # REPEAT: "16"             # pass@k samples per problem
    # MAX_TOKENS: "400000"     # generous ceiling for reasoning traces
    # NUM_THREADS: "512"       # client-side concurrency
    # TEMPERATURE: "1.0"
    # TOP_P: "1.0"
    # SEED: "42"               # --starting_seed for reproducibility
  command: |
    bash /configs/aime/run.sh
```

Set the eval container alias in `srtslurm.yaml`:

```yaml
containers:
  nemo-skills: "/shared/containers/nvidia+eval-factory+nemo-skills+26.03.sqsh"
```

Pre-cache the squashfs with: `enroot import 'docker://nvcr.io#nvidia/eval-factory/nemo-skills:26.03'`.

### Reasoning-mode env vars (server side)

For reasoning-capable models (DeepSeek-V4-Pro thinking, GPT-OSS, etc.) — without
these the model emits non-reasoning answers and AIME pass@k drops ~30 points
below what the model can do.

```yaml
backend:
  prefill_environment:
    SGLANG_ENABLE_THINKING: "1"
    SGLANG_REASONING_EFFORT: "max"
  decode_environment:
    SGLANG_ENABLE_THINKING: "1"
    SGLANG_REASONING_EFFORT: "max"
```

### What the script does

1. `ns prepare_data $DATASET` — fetches the dataset into the NeMo Skills install.
2. `ns eval ...` against `http://localhost:8000/v1` (the in-job dynamo frontend),
   pass@k=`$REPEAT`, with the upstream reasoning-eval reference's tuning
   defaults. NeMo Skills' default `\boxed{}` extractor scores the generations.

Outputs land at `/logs/accuracy/<dataset>/eval-results/<dataset>/metrics.json`
with pass@1, pass@N, and majority@N.

### Custom answer-extraction regex (not currently applied)

The SGLang team's reasoning-eval reference suggests broadening the answer extractor with these two `ns eval` overrides:

```
++eval_config.extract_from_boxed=False
++eval_config.extract_regex=(?:\boxed\{|\*\*Answer\*\*[^0-9\-]{0,30}|(?i:final answer)[^0-9\-]{0,30}|(?i:answer)\s*(?:is|=|:)[^0-9\-]{0,30})(-?\d+)
```

`run.sh` does **not** pass them. `ns eval` forwards Hydra `++overrides` to parallel
`python -m nemo_skills.inference.generate` subprocesses through nemo-run, which
constructs the inner command line **unquoted** — bash strips backslashes from
the regex before Python `re.compile` sees it, the regex becomes invalid, and
every generate subprocess crashes on import. Verified on cluster runs that
produced empty output dirs and a false "Benchmark completed successfully".

If you need a broader extractor for your model, post-process the cached
`output-rs<seed>.jsonl` files with a Python script (raw-string regex, no shell
layers).


## MMLU

For MMLU dataset, the benchmark section in yaml file can be modified in the following way:
```bash
benchmark:
  type: "mmlu"
  num_examples: 200 # Number of examples to run
  max_tokens: 2048 # Max number of output tokens
  repeat: 8 # Number of repetition
  num_threads: 512 # Number of parallel threads for running benchmark
```
 
Then launch the script as usual:
```bash
srtctl apply -f config.yaml
```

After finishing benchmarking, the `benchmark.out` will contain the results of accuracy:
```
====================
Repeat: 8, mean: 0.812
Scores: ['0.790', '0.820', '0.800', '0.820', '0.820', '0.790', '0.820', '0.840']
====================

```


## GPQA
For GPQA dataset, the benchmark section in yaml file can be modified in the following way:
```bash
benchmark:
  type: "gpqa"
  num_examples: 198 # Number of examples to run
  max_tokens: 65536 # We need a larger output token number for GPQA
  repeat: 8 # Number of repetition
  num_threads: 128 # Number of parallel threads for running benchmark
```
The `context-length` argument here should be set to a value larger than `max_tokens`.


## LongBench-V2

LongBench-V2 is a long-context evaluation benchmark that tests model performance on extended context tasks. It's particularly useful for validating models with large context windows (128K+ tokens).

### Configuration

```yaml
benchmark:
  type: "longbenchv2"
  max_context_length: 128000  # Maximum context length (default: 128000)
  num_threads: 16             # Concurrent evaluation threads (default: 16)
  max_tokens: 16384           # Maximum output tokens (default: 16384)
  num_examples: 100           # Number of examples to run (default: all)
  categories:                 # Task categories to evaluate (default: all)
    - "single_doc_qa"
    - "multi_doc_qa"
    - "summarization"
    - "few_shot_learning"
    - "code_completion"
    - "synthetic"
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_context_length` | int | 128000 | Maximum context length for evaluation. Should not exceed model's trained context window. |
| `num_threads` | int | 16 | Number of concurrent threads for parallel evaluation. Increase for faster throughput on high-capacity endpoints. |
| `max_tokens` | int | 16384 | Maximum tokens for model output. Must be less than `context-length` in sglang_config. |
| `num_examples` | int | all | Limit the number of examples to evaluate. Useful for quick validation runs. |
| `categories` | list | all | Specific task categories to run. Omit to run all categories. |

### Available Categories

LongBench-V2 includes the following task categories:

- **single_doc_qa**: Single document question answering
- **multi_doc_qa**: Multi-document question answering
- **summarization**: Long document summarization
- **few_shot_learning**: Few-shot learning with long context
- **code_completion**: Long-context code completion
- **synthetic**: Synthetic long-context tasks (needle-in-haystack, etc.)

### Example: Full Evaluation

Run complete LongBench-V2 evaluation with all categories:

```yaml
name: "longbench-v2-eval"

model:
  path: "deepseek-r1"
  container: "latest"
  precision: "fp8"

resources:
  gpu_type: "gb200"
  prefill_nodes: 2
  decode_nodes: 4

backend:
  type: sglang
  sglang_config:
    prefill:
      context-length: 131072  # Must exceed max_tokens
      tensor-parallel-size: 4
    decode:
      context-length: 131072
      tensor-parallel-size: 8

benchmark:
  type: "longbenchv2"
  max_context_length: 128000
  max_tokens: 16384
  num_threads: 32
```

### Example: Quick Validation

Run a quick subset for validation:

```yaml
benchmark:
  type: "longbenchv2"
  num_examples: 50           # Limit to 50 examples
  num_threads: 8
  categories:
    - "single_doc_qa"        # Only run single-doc QA
```

### Output

After completion, results are saved to the logs directory:

```bash
/logs/accuracy/longbenchv2_<model_name>.json
```

The output includes per-category scores and aggregate metrics:

```json
{
  "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
  "scores": {
    "single_doc_qa": 0.82,
    "multi_doc_qa": 0.78,
    "summarization": 0.85,
    "few_shot_learning": 0.76,
    "code_completion": 0.81,
    "synthetic": 0.92
  },
  "overall_score": 0.82,
  "total_examples": 500,
  "total_latency_s": 1842.5
}
```

### Important Notes

1. **Context Length**: Ensure `context-length` in your sglang_config exceeds `max_tokens` for the benchmark
2. **Memory**: Long-context evaluation requires significant GPU memory. Use appropriate `mem-fraction-static` settings
3. **Throughput**: Increase `num_threads` for faster evaluation, but monitor for OOM errors
4. **Categories**: Running specific categories is useful for targeted validation (e.g., just testing summarization capabilities)


## lm-eval (InferenceX)

The `lm-eval` benchmark runner integrates [EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) via InferenceX's `benchmark_lib.sh`. Unlike the built-in benchmarks above, this runner sources evaluation logic from an external InferenceX workspace mounted at `/infmax-workspace`.

This is used by InferenceX CI to run evals such as GSM8K and GPQA against NVIDIA multi-node disaggregated deployments on GB200, GB300, B200, B300, H100, and H200. AMD MI355X multi-node evals are handled by InferenceX's upstreamed AMD Slurm path, not by this srt-slurm runner.

In InferenceX CI, recipes normally keep their throughput benchmark configuration. `do_sweep.py` invokes the registered `lm-eval` runner as a post-step when `RUN_EVAL=true`, or as the only benchmark-like step when `EVAL_ONLY=true`. There is no separate `infmax-eval` benchmark type.

### How it works

1. `RuntimeContext` mounts the host path from `INFMAX_WORKSPACE` at `/infmax-workspace` inside the Slurm container.
2. `do_sweep.py` starts infrastructure, workers, and the frontend for the normal recipe topology.
3. For `EVAL_ONLY=true`, `do_sweep.py` skips the throughput benchmark stage and runs `_run_post_eval()` directly after frontend startup.
4. `_run_post_eval()` waits for the OpenAI-compatible endpoint on port 8000 and, in eval-only mode, performs the full `wait_for_model()` health check for the configured prefill/decode or aggregated topology.
5. `_run_post_eval()` launches the registered `lm-eval` runner on the head node and passes through InferenceX metadata such as framework, precision, sequence length, prefill/decode topology, and eval concurrency.
6. The runner script (`benchmarks/scripts/lm-eval/bench.sh`) uses `MODEL_NAME` from `do_sweep.py`, or auto-discovers the served model from `/v1/models` as a fallback.
7. The runner sources `/infmax-workspace/benchmarks/benchmark_lib.sh`, runs `run_eval --framework lm-eval`, and calls `append_lm_eval_summary`.
8. Eval artifacts are copied to `/logs/eval_results/` for InferenceX launcher-side artifact pickup.

### EVAL_ONLY mode

srt-slurm supports an `EVAL_ONLY` mode for CI jobs that should only validate accuracy. This is controlled by environment variables from the InferenceX workflow:

| Env var | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `EVAL_ONLY` | Set to `true` to skip the throughput benchmark stage and run eval only |
| `RUN_EVAL` | Set to `true` to run eval after the throughput benchmark completes |
| `EVAL_CONC` | Concurrent requests for lm-eval, normally set by InferenceX from the generated `eval-conc` value |
| `INFMAX_WORKSPACE` | Host path to the InferenceX checkout that should be mounted at `/infmax-workspace` |
| `MODEL_NAME` | Served model alias for OpenAI-compatible requests; set by `do_sweep.py` from `config.served_model_name` |

When `EVAL_ONLY=true`:
- Stage 4 skips the throughput benchmark entirely. No throughput result JSON is expected from srt-slurm.
- The eval path uses the full `wait_for_model()` health check before starting lm-eval.
- `_run_post_eval()` launches the `lm-eval` runner and returns its exit code.
- Eval failure is fatal because eval is the only purpose of the job.

When `RUN_EVAL=true` (without `EVAL_ONLY`):
- Throughput benchmark runs normally
- After benchmark completes successfully, eval runs as a post-step
- Eval failure is non-fatal; the benchmark job still succeeds if throughput passed

### Environment variables

The following env vars are passed through to the lm-eval runner container:

| Env var | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `RUN_EVAL`, `EVAL_ONLY`, `IS_MULTINODE` | Control whether eval runs and how InferenceX classifies the artifact |
| `FRAMEWORK`, `PRECISION`, `MODEL_PREFIX`, `RUNNER_TYPE`, `SPEC_DECODING` | Benchmark identity metadata for `meta_env.json` |
| `ISL`, `OSL`, `RESULT_FILENAME` | Sequence length and result-file metadata |
| `MODEL`, `MODEL_PATH`, `MODEL_NAME` | Model metadata and the served model alias used for requests |
| `MAX_MODEL_LEN`, `EVAL_MAX_MODEL_LEN` | Context-length metadata used by InferenceX eval helpers when available |
| `PREFILL_TP`, `PREFILL_EP`, `PREFILL_NUM_WORKERS`, `PREFILL_DP_ATTN` | Prefill-side topology metadata |
| `DECODE_TP`, `DECODE_EP`, `DECODE_NUM_WORKERS`, `DECODE_DP_ATTN` | Decode-side topology metadata |
| `EVAL_CONC`, `EVAL_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` | Eval concurrency controls |

The runner maps srt-slurm's `PREFILL_DP_ATTN` and `DECODE_DP_ATTN` names to InferenceX's `PREFILL_DP_ATTENTION` and `DECODE_DP_ATTENTION` names before calling `append_lm_eval_summary`. This is required for multi-node summary tables to preserve prefill/decode DPA state.

### Concurrency

Eval concurrency is ultimately read by InferenceX's `benchmark_lib.sh` from `EVAL_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`. The runner script sets that value from `EVAL_CONC` when present, preserves an existing `EVAL_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` otherwise, and falls back to `256` only if neither variable is set:

```bash
export EVAL_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS="${EVAL_CONC:-${EVAL_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS:-256}}"
```

The InferenceX workflow sets `EVAL_CONC` from the generated `eval-conc` value. For multi-node configs, InferenceX selects the `8k1k` entry with the highest max eligible concurrency for each `(model, runner, framework, precision, spec-decoding, prefill-dp-attn, decode-dp-attn)` group, then sets `eval-conc` to the upper median of that config's eligible concurrency list. If `EVAL_CONC` is not set in the environment, `do_sweep.py` falls back to the max of the recipe benchmark concurrency list.

### Output

Eval artifacts are written to `/logs/eval_results/` inside the container:
- `meta_env.json` - metadata used by InferenceX aggregation and summary tables
- `results*.json` - lm-eval scores per task
- `sample*.jsonl` - per-sample outputs

These are collected by the InferenceX NVIDIA launch scripts and uploaded as workflow artifacts. In eval-only mode the InferenceX workflow expects eval artifacts, not throughput benchmark artifacts.

### Intricacies
1. Eval floor of 16
  - There is 1 sweep config of conc: [1], which causes evals to take >4hrs to complete.
